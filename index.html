                <div class="container"><p>Socioeconomic status can deeply affect one’s mental health. One of my closest friends was headed on his way to Northern Michigan University this summer and a fatal accident changed that for him. Because his family had a lower-class status, all the money went to the hospital fees and he lost his opportunity to go to University, deeply affecting his mental health. Going from an optimistic future, to a depressing reality. 
As college students we know the importance of mental health; it’s as crucial as other physical signs of wellbeing. Along with this, throughout this course we have learned about how socioeconomic status can impact many aspects of an individual's life. We feel it is important to understand how these two factors correlate with one another. Mental health in correlation to socioeconomic status is something we as a society need to be more aware of due to the ravaging effects it can have on the minds of individuals.
 People suffer everyday from mental health issues related to socioeconomic status. It impedes the way they think of themselves and can degrade many aspects of their life. Individuals with low socioeconomic status do not have the same access to resources that others have. Because they lack the same privileges as others, it can add to the decline in their mental health. Along with this, educational success is highly correlated to one's mental health. Children with low socioeconomic status are three times more likely to develop mental health problems. The lack of understanding from others and lack of resources available to those in a low socioeconomic status contributes to a never ending cycle of poverty and mental illness. Families in a low socioeconomic status will stay in that low socioeconomic status because of the sheer lack of understanding about mental health and may hinder their academic and employment opportunities. Society must be more informed of these issues, and there needs to be more available resources as well as more awareness in order to end this cycle.
As individuals, we may feel it’s impossible to make a change, however we can vote officials in office to enact policies to make changes that positively impact the mental health of those in poverty. Additionally, there is an organization called Mental Health America; they look for early identification of mental health problems and stages interventions and services for those dealing with severe mental issues. Phone Number: (703)-684-7722, Mental Health America Website. This organization is a resource to support us all. They offer an opportunity for people to become informed about mental health, while also offering free resources to help individuals struggling in a low socioeconomic status. Their goal is to advocate, educate and help people recover. It is essential that people have a higher awareness of this situation around the world and be able to help these people. Something as simple as raising awareness can do a huge favor for people dealing with mental health issues as it allows for others to be able to diagnose the situation and do anything they can to help. This is a problem that may take generations to solve, but with these actions, you can contribute to making the world a better place.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Those with less security against disaster tend to have more anxiety for themselves and their families, causing more mental health issues among those with less material wealth. In addition to this, studies have shown that those with preexisting mental health issues tend to fall into poverty. This cycle has been going on in low-middle income countries throughout history. One way that studies have shown to break the cycle is with mental health care in tandem with financial aid. The study found out that financial aid on its own does not do anything to help those in a position of being mentally-ill and socioeconomically disabled. The financial aid helps in their immediate needs, but does not address the need of the mind. Hence the studies finding that healthcare in tandem with financial aid is the best solution. One or the other will not address the issues, they must work together.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">In this video, Crick Lund,  a Principal Investigator of the Africa Focus on Intervention Research for Mental Health, discusses why it is paramount we should focus on poverty's effects on mental health. He brings up an important fact, over 350 million people across the world are diagnosed with depression, and most of those who are diagnosed come from low/middle income countries. It shows an obvious fact that poverty is correlated with depression in a significant manner. Crick speaks of his past, when he was a clinical psychologist, on how he met many patients whose depression was intertwined with their poverty. After Crick’s experience as a psychologist, he decided that helping people one by one wasn’t enough to fix the issue. He refocused his efforts into public services that deal with mental ailments on a communal level.

                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>Not only is mental health affected by what socioeconomic status you hold, but also, certain aspirations may hurt mental health even more. Where someone would like to be versus where they end up is a massive difference maker to one’s mental health. Someone can become more depressed and anxious if they do not achieve what they set out to achieve, and on the contrary one can become happier if they achieve their goals and potentially overachieve them. These two things having a direct correlation to one’s mental health can help us get a better understanding of the situation. Socioeconomic status plays an important role in its relationship with mental health, however being able to reach one’s set socioeconomic goals or not takes a heavy toll on the mind.

                                    <p class="mb-4">One case study describes numerous results from other studies about mental health in relation to socioeconomic status as inconsistent. The journal stated that these discrepancies were born due to the non-uniform definitions of poverty within the studies. They attempt to re-examine results of a study under socioeconomic statuses that are clearly defined with additional data to support their results. “In this study [they] used data from the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement” (Mclaughlin). With these redefined standards, the journal showcased that parents who had less than a college degree had a higher chance at getting a mental disorder. That point carried on to the children as well, as the study states, “adolescents whose parents had some college education but did not complete a degree were more likely to have a mental disorder across all diagnostic groups.” The results of the parents having a heavy impact on the mind of their children is upsetting to see as it affects generations of children. This is another factor that contributes to this devastating cycle of poverty and mental illness.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Socioeconomically disadvantaged families were approximately two to three times more likely to develop mental health problems than their peers from socioeconomically advantaged families. Low socioeconomic status that persisted over time was found to be associated with higher rates of mental health problems. As this study also shows, parental psychopathology was found to be a main predictor in a childs or adolescents mental health. As mental health problems can be carried into adulthood, this creates a “cycle of deprivation and mental health problems across generations.” This statistical evidence showcases the correlation between socioeconomic status and mental health within children and how dangerous it can be to the mind.

                                    <p class="mb-4">Socioeconomic status and mental health are directly correlated across the whole world. This video discusses the effects socioeconomic status has on the mental health of Canadian children. In 2019, one in nine Canadian children lived in poverty. They found that children in a low socioeconomic status were three times more likely to develop mental health issues than those who had high socioeconomic status. Another study was conducted finding that 22% of children will develop anxiety in their lifetime, a majority of those children coming from a lower socioeconomic status. The video elaborates on the importance that teachers become more aware and more educated on how to support students with mental health issues. Oftentimes teachers alienate or disregard their students because of a lack of care displayed, but it is found that children from low socioeconomic status display symptoms such as lack of caring or motivation when they are depressed. Due to this, it is proven that teachers show more negative attitudes towards low socioeconomic students in terms of their future success and academic ability. Without teacher involvement, students will continue to feel unsupported leading to a decline in their learning, along with social and emotional development. The video argues that in order to make changes, people, students, teachers, and health professionals must work to reduce the stigma associated with mental health disorders instead of setting up institutionalized barriers and segregating individuals with mental health disorders. A possible source of combating this issue would be to provide teachers with education training about mental health issues. This will help to ensure students feel safe and secure in the classroom while also ensuring they are able to succeed.</p>
